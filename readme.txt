Add CSS to your blocks and patterns right in the editor!

== Description ==

The missing inline block CSS editor for the Gutenberg editor. Very powerful with synced patterns as well. And it pairs well with global styles.

This plugin is perfect for users looking to add CSS for blocks without needing to create a child theme, or use a bloated plugin. Client safe too. CSS won't leak outside of the block, and only valid block CSS is persisted.

= How to =
- Every block will have a new "Pattern CSS" settings panel.
- Open it and add any CSS. It will be scoped to the block.
- To target the block directly, you must use the `[block]` selector.
- To target any element *inside* the block, use the normal CSS selector.
- Use `!important` to override your theme styles (use sparingly)

= Features =
- Powered by WebAssembly for fast and secure CSS parsing
- Smart loading. Only loads the CSS when the block is present
- Styles persist when changing themes
- Scopes styles to the block so that parent/sibling blocks are not affected
- It's fast
- CSS is minified and optimized
- It's safe. Invalid, non-spec CSS is never persisted
- Supports reusable (synced or not-synced) patterns
- See changes on the page as you make them
- Combines adjacent rules (to decrease size)
- Minifies colors and math functions to simplify according to spec
- Supports CSS nesting

= Basic Example =
`/* Target the block directly */
[block] {
  background: antiquewhite;
  padding: 2rem;
}
/* Target any inner elements */
a {
  text-decoration-color: burlywood;
  text-decoration-thickness: 2px;
  text-decoration-style: solid !important;
}
a:hover {
  text-decoration-color: darkgoldenrod;
}

/* Output: */
.pcss-a1b7b016{background:#faebd7;padding:2rem}.pcss-a1b7b016 a{text-decoration-color:#deb887;text-decoration-thickness:2px;text-decoration-style:solid!important}.pcss-a1b7b016 a:hover{text-decoration-color:#b8860b}`

= Supports Media Queries =
`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  [block] {
    border-color: blue;
  }
}

/* Output: */
@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){.pcss-cddaa023{border-color:#00f}}`

= Combines Rules =
`[block] {
  color: red;
}
.bar {
  color: red;
}

/* Output: */
.pcss-3aa0f0fc,.pcss-3aa0f0fc .bar{color:red}`

= Fixes redundant properties =
`[block] {
  padding-top: 5px;
  padding-left: 50px;
  padding-bottom: 15px;
  padding-right: 5px;
}

/* Output: */
.pcss-3aa0f0fc{padding:5px 5px 15px 50px}`

= Supports CSS nesting =
`[block] {
  padding: 1rem;
  a {
    color: red;
  }
  background: white;
  /* Including media queries */
  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    background: black;
    color:white;
  }
}

/* Output: */
.pcss-f526bb2d{background:#fff;padding:1rem;& a{color:red}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){&{color:#fff;background:#000}}}`

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Error about application/wasm mime type =

Your server needs to be able to identify the mime type being used. See here: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/webassembly-instantiatestreaming-failed-because-your-server-does-not-serve-wasm/

= Can I use something other than [block]? =

You can add a custom selector via a PHP constant. It requires setting a type (type, attribute, etc) and the name.

Here's an example for "foo { color: red }", where foo will be replaced with .pcss-h3Hso39bsK (or something similar):

Add this to functions.php:

`define('PATTERN_CSS_SELECTOR_OVERRIDE', ['name' => 'foo', 'type' => 'type']);`

== Screenshots ==

1. Add styles not available in the editor
2. Supports reusable and synced patterns too
3. Will warn you if your CSS is invalid
